        <p>
          Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976, in Vancouver,
          British Columbia. He is the youngest of four sons. His father, James
          Chester Reynolds, was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman before
          retiring from the force and going to work as a foods wholesaler. His
          mother, Tamara Lee (née Stewart) worked in retail sales. Reynolds has
          two brothers who work in law enforcement in British Columbia, one of
          whom followed his father into the RCMP. His paternal grandfather,
          Chester Reynolds, was a farmer who represented Stettler in the
          Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1940 to 1944. Reynolds has Irish
          and Scottish ancestry, and was raised in the Roman Catholic Church in
          Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reynolds has been involved in acting since age thirteen. He graduated
          from Kitsilano Secondary School in 1994, which he attended with actor
          Joshua Jackson. Reynolds played small roles in a number of television
          series, but became discouraged and quit acting at age 19 to enroll at
          Kwantlen Polytechnic University. A few months later he ran into fellow
          actor Chris William Martin, who convinced him to try again and move
          with him to Los Angeles.

              Reynolds's career began in 1991 when he starred as Billy Simpson
              in the Canadian-produced teen soap opera Hillside, distributed in
              the United States by Nickelodeon as Fifteen. In 1993, Reynolds
              played a child who moves from India to Canada after the death of
              his father in the film Ordinary Magic. Between 1993 and 1994, he
              had a recurring role in The Odyssey as Macro. In 1996, he had a
              supporting role as Jay "Boom" DeBoom in "Syzygy", the thirteenth
              episode of the third season of The X-Files, and co-starred with
              Melissa Joan Hart in the TV movie Sabrina the Teenage Witch. In
              1996, Reynolds played Bobby Rupp, boyfriend of murdered teen Nancy
              Clutter, in a two-part miniseries In Cold Blood, an adaptation of
              Truman Capote's non-fiction novel of the same name. He also
              appeared in the anthology The Outer Limits episode "Origin of the
              Species", which originally aired on November 14, 1998. Beginning
              in 1998, Reynolds starred in Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place,

            <p>
              In 2016, Reynolds found critical and commercial success with
              Deadpool, a film that had been in development as early as 2000.
              After portraying Wade Wilson / Weapon XI, without the name
              Deadpool, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he became heavily involved
              in the development of a Deadpool film. Deadpool featured a reboot
              of the character, ignoring the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine,
              and establishing a new backstory for the character that was closer
              to the Marvel Comics source material. The film takes place within
              the larger 20th Century Fox X-Men film universe, being made
              possible by the reset timeline in X-Men: Days of Future Past.
              Deadpool made several box-office records, including: a worldwide
              opening of $264.9 million from 62 markets, which is the biggest of
              2016, the biggest for an R-rated film, and the second biggest for
              Fox, only behind Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith
              ($303.9 million).[32][33] It also recorded the biggest IMAX 2D
              worldwide opening of all time with $27.4 million from 606 IMAX
              theatres, eclipsing The Dark Knight Rises ($23.8 million).[34][35]
              The film's financial and critical success led the studio to move
              forward with a sequel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in 2016, Reynolds had a supporting role in the Ariel
              Vromen-directed thriller Criminal. On December 15, 2016, Reynolds
              received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood
              Boulevard. Reynolds co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca
              Ferguson in the science fiction thriller Life in 2017, which
              reunited him with Safe House director Daniel Espinosa.[38]
              Reynolds began filming Deadpool 2 in June 2017. The film opened on
              May 18, 2018. In May 2019, he starred as the titular character in
              Pokémon Detective Pikachu, a live action film adaptation of the
              Detective Pikachu video game. Reynolds voiced, and was the facial
              motion capture actor for the CGI detective Pikachu.
            </p>
            <p>
              In January 2019, Reynolds was named the face of Armani Code
              leading with a campaign for their Absolu scent.[42] Also that
              year, he starred in the Netflix action thriller film 6
              Underground, directed by Michael Bay. The film was released on
              December 13.

            <p>
              Although he had performed primarily in comedies, Reynolds
              underwent intense physical training to play an action role as the
              character of Hannibal King in the 2004 film Blade: Trinity. The
              same year, he made a cameo appearance in Harold & Kumar Go to
              White Castle as a nurse. Reynolds played George Lutz in the 2005
              remake of the 1979 horror film The Amityville Horror. Also in
              2005, he played a waiter named Monty in Waiting... and appeared as
              music executive Chris Brander in the romantic comedy Just Friends
              alongside Amy Smart and Anna Faris. In Just Friends, Reynolds
              lip-synced "I Swear" over the end credits. Additionally, he played
              an FBI agent alongside Ray Liotta in the 2006 crime action film
              Smokin' Aces. Reynolds played the protagonist in the 2008 film
              Definitely, Maybe. He also appeared in the second-season finale of
              the television series Scrubs. In 2007, Reynolds guest-starred as
              Brendan's friend Hams in the episode "Douchebag in the City" of
              the TBS sitcom My Boys.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reynolds portrayed Wade Wilson / Weapon XI in a supporting role in
              the prequel 20th Century Fox X-Men film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine,
              which was released in 2009. He had previously spoken of his
              interest and involvement in a possible film adaptation of Deadpool
              with screenwriter David S. Goyer as far back as 2005. 2009 also
              saw Reynolds portray Andrew Paxton, opposite Sandra Bullock, in
              The Proposal, and Mike Connell in Adventureland.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2010, Reynolds starred in the Spanish and American thriller
              Buried, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. In June
              2010, Reynolds was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture
              Arts and Sciences. Reynolds portrayed the Hal Jordan version of
              superhero Green Lantern in Warner Bros.' film Green Lantern, which
              was released on June 17, 2011. The film did not fare well either
              financially or critically, but his role made him one of the few
              actors to headline films based on both Marvel and DC characters.
              In 2011, he co-starred in the comedy The Change-Up, as well as
              narrating the documentary film The Whale. In 2012, he portrayed an
              agent in Safe House, alongside Denzel Washington. He then had
              starring roles in two DreamWorks Animation feature films, The
              Croods and Turbo, both released in 2013. His next role was
              portraying Nick Walker in the Universal Pictures film adaptation
              of Dark Horse Comics' R.I.P.D. (Rest in Peace Department), which
              was released in 2013. Reynolds went on to star in low-budget
              films, The Voices and The Captive in 2014, as well as Mississippi
              Grind the following year. This was followed by a supporting role
              in the financially successful biographical film, Woman in Gold,
              before he returned to the thriller genre with Self/Less, also in
              2015.
